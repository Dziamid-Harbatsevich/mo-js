Menu Object (mo.js)
=====

A mobile-first, progressively enhanced, standards based, responsive navigation menu system. Need any more buzzwords?

Here's how it works:

* By default, menu items are centered, one following another. "Pills" if you're familiar with Twitter Bootstrap.
* On larger screen sizes display a typical drop down menu via :hover.
* If viewed on a touch device, replace :hover with arrows for expanding/contracting submenus.
* Progressively enhance to support toggled visibility of a vertical mobile menu.
* All menu levels should be available regardless of the device.
* Should handle multiple menus without issue.

HTML structure will follow the default WordPress menu output. CSS/Javascript will take inspiration from sources such as the Superfish menu and responsive-nav.com.
